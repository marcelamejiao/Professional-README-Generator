# Professional README generator

## **This application was created to generate a professional README for a new project.**
 
* The user can open the console and insert the following command: 
```
node index.js
```
* The console displays a prompt with diverse questions to be answered: Project title, description, instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions and a license list.

* When the user choose the license, a badge is displayed on the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
* The GitHub username is asked and linked to the user's GitHub profile.
* The user's email is required and displayed on the questions section.
* A table of content is automatic created with links to help the user to navigate through and be taken to the corresponding section of the README.
